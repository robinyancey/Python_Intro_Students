    "An <b> abstract data type</b> is a set of objects and operations that can be performed on this data type.\n",
    "As a basic example, lists in the general sense are an abstract data type.  We know a list is just a collection of items. Generally speaking, we should be able to add to lists, remove from lists, sort lists, etc. This general idea of the abstract list type is the framework behind the built-in list data type in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "A <b> class </b> is the representation of an abstract data type in Python. A class defines the information and behavior of any object that is part of this class. \n",
    "\n",
    "A <b>method</b> is simply a function that is specific to a type of object. The `set` class has an `add` method (a function that can only be performed for sets). The `list` class has a `sort` method (a function specifically to sort a list). \n",
    "\n",
    "An <b>object</b> is a specific instance of the class. Each object has a type (i.e. the class that the object is in).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Encapsulation</b> generally refers to this idea that an object works like a black bock. The data it stores (its information) and the procedures it can perform (it's methods) form a unit. The details of all this doesn't necessarily have to be clear to use this object. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Polymorphism</b> refers to how a single operation can have different results based on the object it is used on. As an example, $+$ has different meanings. Polymorphism allows us to use an operation on different data types and provides flexibility in code. "
