    "## Creating a text-based adventure game\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is about completing a small text-based adventure game. The storyline of is based on the novella <i>The Strange Library</i> by Haruki Murakami. In our game, our hero somehow gets lost in a library and is trying to find their way back out. The game is built like a graph made of a series of rooms. Controlled by user input, the hero moves from room to room until they find an exit. The rooms have various items and characters in them. Each room has a set of other rooms that are accessible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our world has rooms, characters, and items.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build our game, we first must define a series of classes. Here are a list of the classes used to create this game:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li><b> Items: </b>   Represents any item in the library. </li>\n",
    "        <li><b> Keys: </b>  Keys are a subclass of Items.</li> \n",
    "    <li><b> Rooms: </b>Represents a room in the library.  </li> \n",
    "    <li><b> Characters: </b> Represents a generic character in the story. </li> \n",
    "    <li><b> Hero: </b>  The Hero class is a subclass of a Character. In our program, we will only create a single Hero object. This is our main character and the character the user controls via text input.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "The user will type in commands to control the Hero. The Hero will move around to from room to rooms in our library world until they find a way out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some these classes were introduced in earlier lab assignments. We will work on more fleshed out versions of these classes here. \n"
